# What Makes A Good Leader?

Effective leaders are found in all forms and ways, but are there common characteristics and leadership traits that many of these leaders share? What weight to these traits have in creating a better environment for his employees and effectively leading his teams? Are there other factors that make a leader more credible in the eyes of his employees?

By using power analyses, bootstrap resampling, and heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrices, I was able to effectively test several hypotheses and identify some traits and characteristics of leaders in demonstrating credibility and effectiveness in the workplace. Moving forward, this can help business unit leaders and HR managers to identify parameters for improvement for themselves potential recruits.
